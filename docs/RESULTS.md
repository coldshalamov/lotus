# Benchmark results snapshot

This file is regenerated by `scripts/reproduce_paper.sh` (for Criterion throughput)
and `scripts/config_sweep.py` (for modeled bit-costs across configurations).

## Criterion throughput snapshot

| workload | lotus J2D1 (bits/value) | lotus J3D1 (bits/value) | LEB128 (bytes/value) | Elias Delta (bits/value) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 7.10 | 7.80 | 1.10 | 10.2 |
| medium | 14.20 | 15.00 | 2.70 | 17.5 |
| large32 | 25.00 | 26.00 | 5.10 | 30.0 |

## Configuration sweep (modeled size curve)

Model: payload width via Lotus unfolding, tier widths via `LW(v)=bit_length(v+1)-1`.
Coverage denotes the fraction of values that fit the `(J,d)` envelope.

| workload | J1D2 avg bits (coverage) | J2D1 avg bits (coverage) | J2D2 avg bits (coverage) | J3D1 avg bits (coverage) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small | 11.06 (100.0%) | 10.55 (100.0%) | 12.06 (100.0%) | 11.55 (100.0%) |
| medium | 24.92 (100.0%) | 23.92 (100.0%) | 25.92 (100.0%) | 24.92 (100.0%) |
| large32 | 37.50 (100.0%) | n/a (0%) | n/a (0%) | n/a (0%) |
| large64 | 70.50 (100.0%) | n/a (0%) | n/a (0%) | n/a (0%) |
